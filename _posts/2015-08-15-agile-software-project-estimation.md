# Agile Software Project Estimation #

Today I was offered a short term contract at World Union of Credit Unions, a company I had applied to as a Web Developer. They were interested in hiring me, but because most of my prior experience was in maintaining other people's work they wanted to see how well I handled developing new features of my own. Fair enough. I get paid, they get to see how I work, I get to see how well I work with the other developer, and at the end maybe I get a full time gig. It's all good.

My past experience was in an Agile shop using Scrum for software estimation. I figure some sort of Agile estimation would be a good choice here so I'm going to go ahead and use Scrum again, or at least a bastardized version of it. I was a little involved in the process at my old job, but didn't carry any project from start to finish so this should be an interesting dive into project management.

## Scrum, Cherry Picking the Parts I Need ##

Scrum is a whole project management system that is honestly too large for a one person team working on a small project. However, there are a few Scrum practices I want to use.

### Product Backlog ###

The Product Backlog is the master list of all the features that are desired in a product. They are often expressed as User Stories.

### User Stories ###

User stories are descriptions of some feature a user would want usually written in a way that non-technical people can understand. The general format of a user story is as follows:

> As a <role>, I want <goal/desire>, so that <benefit>

An example of a real user story might be:

> As a user, I want to be able to search for a product by name, so that I can quickly find the product I'm looking for

### Sprints ###

In many Agile disciples, there's this concept of a sprint. A sprint is a short period of time, generally between one week to one month (often two weeks). Since my contract is only intended to last somewhere between 2-4 weeks, I will have a shortened sprint, maybe as little as 3 days long, but no more than a week.

During the sprint, the team focuses on a small set of features that can be deliverable by the end of the sprint. These features come from the Sprint Backlog, a list that takes a set of items from the Product Backlog. Any deliverable items should meet the team's definition of done.

### Definition of Done ###

The definition of done is what the team decides will define when a feature is done and ready to be delivered to the end user or customer. My definition of done will be met once a feature has been Coded, Tested, and Documented.

### Sprint Planning ###

At the beginning of a sprint, the team decides on what to work on for the upcoming sprint. User Stories from the Procut Backlog are chosen then broken down into discrete tasks. Tasks should be broken down granularly so that each task should take no more than 12 hours or two days. Developers sign up for tasks rather than being assigned tasks so that there's greater dev buy in. Developers estimate how long a task should take them.

Since this project is a showcase of my abilities, I'll prepare the Sprint Backlog myself. I may update the Senior Developer, Dan about what I'm planning to work on for the sprint, but maybe not because there's another way update team members on your status...

### Daily Scrum ###

Every day at the same time is a short standup meeting (meaning you're literally standing up to prevent overlong meetings) lasting no more than 15 minutes. Each team member answers the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday that applies to the sprint goal?
- What am I working on today for the sprint goal?
- Do I or the team have any roadblocks that could prevent the sprint goal from being achieved?

Since I expect to be the only developer on this project, I will probably just send a quick email or video chat with at least Dan if not Dan and Jack. At my last job, we always had the standup meeting right before lunch and I'd like to continue that time tradition.

### Sprint Review and Retrospective ###

This is a time to demo what got done and to review how the sprint went. Any completed features should be shown to stakeholders. This is a good time to get feedback and make sure things are headed on the right path. The great thing about short iterations with sprints is if the customer/stakeholders decide a feature needs to be changed, they want a different feature, or the feature you worked on isn't what they wanted at all, you've only lost a little bit of time and effort and can quickly reprioritize goals.

The retrospective is a time to ask two questions. What went well this sprint and what could be done better next time? It's a process of small, incremental improvement of development processes.

### Burndown charts ###

There are sprint and release burndown charts. The sprint burndown chart showing how much work you have left in the sprint. By the same token, the release burndown chart shows how much work is left until the public release is ready. It's just a handy quick overview visual of how much work is left to do.

I'm not sure if I will use burndown charts since I don't have a large project to work on, but I have a Scrum browser extension for Trello, Plus for Trello, which I believe has burndown chart capabilities.

## The Goal ##

Hopefully, using a few Scrum practices will help me manage my work better than not using Scrum. This will be something I'll have to learn through trial and error. If I do get hired on, I wonder how hard it would be to advocate for an Agile process? It is a very small team so it might be seen as too much overhead. I do believe using some parts of Scrum can only be helpful in the software development process.

# Learning Laravel 5 #

I've decided to start learning the MVC framework for PHP called Laravel. My reasons include:

- I'm starting a contract job where I'll need to demonstrate that I can build software with PHP
- The reddit.com/r/php forum highly regards the Laravel framework
- I need to learn how to use an MVC framework as they're all over the place and I've never used one
- Laravel is pretty popular so I feel confident I can find all the information I need through the [official documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1 "Laravel 5.1 Docs"), [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/ "Laracasts"), this popular Laravel e-book I bought called [Code Bright](https://leanpub.com/codebright "Code Bright by Dayle Rees"), and the general usage of Google and Stack Overflow.

That being said, I'm starting by watching the [Laravel 5 Fundamentals](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-5-fundamentals) Laracast. I'm only on the 2nd video so far and have run into several errors I've had to push through. It seems most of the errors are related to getting up and running on Windows.

Honestly, I'm a bit torn on whether to use Laravel or plain PHP because I just read a blog prescribing new developers to just learn plain PHP well first and that makes sense. I just wonder if using Laravel would make the project faster. However, depending on how long it takes me to learn Laravel I may have to roll with vanilla PHP. I have 2 weeks to try Laravel and see how far I get.

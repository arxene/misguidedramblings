# Welcome to Misguided Ramblings #

## Why are you doing this? ##

I know what you're asking. What is this, who are you, and why have you captured and dragged me to this unidentified building and forced me to read this? All good questions, but I'll be the one asking the questions from here on out so just do what i say and nobody gets hurt.

My name is Ray McMahan and I'm in the midst of month 6 in Unemployment Land. This means I have a lot of time to hang out with my cat and just destroy my Netflix queue. In all seriousness though I'd like to beef up on my knowledge of web development, the career I'm aspiring to.

I spend time on programming forums on Reddit and watching videos like the popular YouTube DevTips, but what I need to spend more time doing is actually building stuff. I also need to have a regular study schedule, not just on days I get out of bed before noon.

The intention of this blog is to serve as a daily diary of what I've learned each day. When learning, it is often helpful to try to explain what you've learned to someone else. Sort of like rubber duck debugging. Also, this should be something potential employers or psycho stalkers can use to determine my worthiness for their purposes.

## First daily entry ##

What I've done today is set up a basic Jekyll blog on Github Pages. I've also read up on Markdown syntax.

Here's my kitty tax for you reading this far.
